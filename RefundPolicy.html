            <p>
              We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that

            <h1>Returning Goods</h1>

            </p>

              service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of

              If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped
              directly to you, You'll receive a gift credit for the value of
              your return. Once the returned product is received, a gift
              certificate will be mailed to You.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift
              giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later,
              We will send the refund to the gift giver.
